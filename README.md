## our insipration

Our team 👥 used inspiration from HackMerced VII's theme *Light the Future* to creat LYF. We wanted to provide an interactive way to show the different time periods human beings have gone through to ge to the present 🕰️. By showcasing different obstacles in each era faced we can show a bit of history in our game.
